The master files for the whole of RepRapPro Mendel are on Github here:

https://github.com/reprappro/Mendel

These are the all the printed parts except the extruder for a RepRapPro Mendel.

See: 

   http://reprappro.com/Tricolour_Mendel

and

   http://reprappro.com/Mono_Mendel

Both machines use the same files from this directory.  Each filename has the number-off
for that part that you need to print as part of its filename.  If you want a cooling fan on
your RepRap (this gives better quality, especially for prints with a small cross-sectional
area) print the optional fan-holder file too; otherwise leave it out.

The Y-motor-mount file is optional - you don't need it if you lasercut the Y motor mount, but
you can also print it.  Similarly with the Y-frog.  This is divided in two (A and B) for 
easier printing; bolt the two halves together with 4 M3x20mm cap screws.  (All the .dxf files for lasercutting are in the dxf directory in the Github repository.) 

In addition, for a Tricolour Mendel you will need three extruder drives from here:

https://github.com/reprappro/Extruder-drive

For a Mono Mendel, you need only one extruder drive.

For build instructions and lists of all the other hardware needed, see here:

RepRapPro sells hardware-only kits to go with the printed parts described above so that
you can print your own RepRap and then get all the additional hardware needed to build
and operate the complete machine from one place.  See the first two links above for details.
